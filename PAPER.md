# **AraGenEval**: Arabic Authorship Style Transfer and AI Generated Text Detection Shared Task 

### Hosted with [The Internation Conference on ArabicNLP 2025](https://arabicnlp2025.sigarab.org/)


### SHARED TASK PAPER SUBMISSION GUIDELINES

#### Paper Structure (4 pages maximum + unlimited references)
**1. Abstract**<br>
Brief summary of your paper in a few sentences.
<br>**2. Introduction**
- Task description and importance; mention language(s) covered; cite task overview paper
- Your main system strategy
- Key findings, ranking, challenges discovered; include code URL if available (Highly recommended)<br>
<br>**3. Background**
- Summarize task setup: input/output types (with examples)
- Dataset details: language, genre, size
- Tracks participated in (if applicable)
- Cite relevant related work showing your contribution's novelty
<br>**4. System Overview** 
- Key algorithms and design decisions
- Resources used beyond provided training data
- How you addressed task challenges
- Include equations/pseudocode for novel approaches
- Provide concrete algorithm examples
- For multiple systems, clearly distinguish each configuration<br>
**5. Experimental Setup**
- Data split usage (train/dev/test)
- Preprocessing and hyperparameter details for replication
- External tools/libraries (with versions and URLs)
- Task evaluation metrics summary
- Put detailed implementation in Appendix if space-limited<br>
**6. Results**
- Quantitative findings: Official metrics performance and ranking
- Analysis: Ablations, comparisons, design decisions impact
- Error analysis: System mistakes, confusion matrices, error types, make sure to provide some examples.
- Clearly mark which data split used for each analysis
- Distinguish official vs. post-submission results<br>
**7. Conclusion**
Summary of system, limitations, results, and future work directions.<br>
**8. Acknowledgments**
Thank contributors, grants, anonymous reviewers.<br>
**9. Appendix**
Low-level details for replication that aren't essential for understanding main concepts.<br>
#### Formatting Requirements ⚠️
**Templates and Style**
- Must use: Official EMNLP 2025 (ACL) style templates (LaTeX or Word)
- Download from: [https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files)
- Follow: General "*ACL" conference formatting guidelines
- Do NOT: Modify style files or use templates from other conferences to avoid the paper rejection<br>
**Consequences**
- Non-conforming submissions (wrong paper size, margins, font size) will be rejected without review<br>
#### Key Principles
**Focus on:**
- **Replicability:** Provide all necessary implementation details
- **Analysis:** Emphasize results over rankings; include multiple runs and ablations
- **Clarity:** Brief task outline (avoid duplicating task paper); use placeholder citations initially<br>
**Required elements:**
- Cite task overview paper
- Follow EMNLP templates exactly
- Use title format: \<Team Name\> at \<Task Name\>: \<Your Contribution\> <br>
**For popular algorithms:** <br> Citation suffices (no need for full mathematical details)<br>
**Space management:** <br> Move detailed parameters/hyperparameters to Appendix if needed
